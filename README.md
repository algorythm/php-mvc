# PHP MVC

## _A Tiny MVC framework by _Anders Wiberg Olsen__

I just want to mention that there are still some bugs, which I haven't fixed yet (I am working on it though). Further more it is important to notice that this system isn't finished yet, and that I am still working on it.

The point of this framework is to have a very simple MVC framework, without too many features. Right now, it is only the MVC-system; very stripped down.
